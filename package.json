  "description": "This project consisted on creating my personal Website, a web application built with HTML/CSS/javascript, where I could experiment different technologies for both FrontEnd and BackEnd, and build a better understanding of the Web principle applications. During the creation of this project I faced several obstacles and difficulties that helped me grow as a Web Developer and become more confident with the tecnhologies behind it.\r The website contains project pages, written articles, and is mainly a place where I can openly share my passions. The goal is to create a page for every project, making it easy for users to download my programs for free, leave feedback, and connect with like minded individuals.",
